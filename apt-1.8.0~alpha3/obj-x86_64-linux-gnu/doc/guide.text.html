The Debian packaging system has a large amount of information associated with
each package to help assure that it integrates cleanly and easily into the
system. The most prominent of its features is the dependency system.
</p></td></tr></table></para><para xmlns=""><table><tr><td>   </td><td><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
The dependency system allows individual programs to make use of shared elements
in the system such as libraries. It simplifies placing infrequently used
portions of a program in separate packages to reduce the number of things the
average user is required to install. Also, it allows for choices in mail
transport agents, X servers and so on.
</p></td></tr></table></para><para xmlns=""><table><tr><td>   </td><td><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
The first step to understanding the dependency system is to grasp the concept
of a simple dependency. The meaning of a simple dependency is that a package
requires another package to be installed at the same time to work properly.
</p></td></tr></table></para><para xmlns=""><table><tr><td>   </td><td><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
For instance, mailcrypt is an emacs extension that aids in encrypting email
with GPG. Without GPGP installed mailcrypt is useless, so mailcrypt has a
simple dependency on GPG. Also, because it is an emacs extension it has a
simple dependency on emacs, without emacs it is completely useless.
</p></td></tr></table></para><para xmlns=""><table><tr><td>   </td><td><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
The other important dependency to understand is a conflicting dependency. It
means that a package, when installed with another package, will not work and
may possibly be extremely harmful to the system. As an example consider a mail
transport agent such as sendmail, exim or qmail. It is not possible to have
two mail transport agents installed because both need to listen to the network
to receive mail. Attempting to install two will seriously damage the system so
all mail transport agents have a conflicting dependency with all other mail
transport agents.
</p></td></tr></table></para><para xmlns=""><table><tr><td>   </td><td><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
As an added complication there is the possibility for a package to pretend to
be another package. Consider that exim and sendmail for many intents are
identical, they both deliver mail and understand a common interface. Hence,
the package system has a way for them to declare that they are both
mail-transport-agents. So, exim and sendmail both declare that they provide a
mail-transport-agent and other packages that need a mail transport agent depend
on mail-transport-agent. This can add a great deal of confusion when trying to
manually fix packages.
</p></td></tr></table></para><para xmlns=""><table><tr><td>   </td><td><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
At any given time a single dependency may be met by packages that are already
installed or it may not be. APT attempts to help resolve dependency issues by
providing a number of automatic algorithms that help in selecting packages for
installation.

Upgrade will attempt to gently upgrade the whole system. Upgrade will never
install a new package or remove an existing package, nor will it ever upgrade a
package that might cause some other package to break. This can be used daily
to relatively safely upgrade the system. Upgrade will list all of the packages
that it could not upgrade, this usually means that they depend on new packages
or conflict with some other package. <span class="command"><strong>dselect</strong></span> or
<code class="literal">apt-get install</code> can be used to force these packages to
install.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">install</span></dt><dd><p>
Install is used to install packages by name. The package is automatically
fetched and installed. This can be useful if you already know the name of the
package to install and do not want to go into a GUI to select it. Any number
of packages may be passed to install, they will all be fetched. Install
automatically attempts to resolve dependency problems with the listed packages
and will print a summary and ask for confirmation if anything other than its
arguments are changed.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">dist-upgrade</span></dt><dd><p>
Dist-upgrade is a complete upgrader designed to simplify upgrading between
releases of Debian. It uses a sophisticated algorithm to determine the best
set of packages to install, upgrade and remove to get as much of the system to
the newest release. In some situations it may be desired to use dist-upgrade
rather than spend the time manually resolving dependencies in
<span class="command"><strong>dselect</strong></span>. Once dist-upgrade has completed then
<span class="command"><strong>dselect</strong></span> can be used to install any packages that may have
been left out.
</p><p>
It is important to closely look at what dist-upgrade is going to do, its
decisions may sometimes be quite surprising.

There are two ways a system can get into a broken state like this. The

supplying the <code class="literal">-f</code> option to <span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span>

Whenever the whole system is being upgraded there is the possibility that new
versions of packages cannot be installed because they require new things or
conflict with already installed things. In this case the package will appear
in the Kept Back list. The best way to convince packages listed there to
install is with <code class="literal">apt-get install</code> or by using
<span class="command"><strong>dselect</strong></span> to resolve their problems.

The first line of the summary simply is a reduced version of all of the lists
and includes the number of upgrades - that is packages already installed that
have new versions available. The second line indicates the number of poorly
configured packages, possibly the result of an aborted installation. The final
line shows the space requirements that the installation needs. The first pair
of numbers refer to the size of the archive files. The first number indicates
the number of bytes that must be fetched from remote locations and the second
indicates the total size of all the archives required. The next number
indicates the size difference between the presently installed packages and the
newly installed packages. It is roughly equivalent to the space required in
/usr after everything is done. If a large number of packages are being removed
then the value may indicate the amount of space that will be freed.

Some other reports can be generated by using the -u option to show packages to
upgrade, they are similar to the previous examples.

The lines starting with <span class="emphasis"><em>Get</em></span> are printed out when APT
begins to fetch a file while the last line indicates the progress of the
download. The first percent value on the progress line indicates the total
percent done of all files. Unfortunately since the size of the Package files
is unknown <code class="literal">apt-get update</code> estimates the percent done which
causes some inaccuracies.

The next section of the status line is repeated once for each download
thread and indicates the operation being performed and some useful
information about what is happening. Sometimes this section will simply
read <span class="emphasis"><em>Forking</em></span> which means the OS is loading the download
module. The first word after the [ is the fetch number as shown on the
history lines. The next word is the short form name of the object being
downloaded. For archives it will contain the name of the package that is
being fetched.

Inside of the single quote is an informative string indicating the progress of
the negotiation phase of the download. Typically it progresses from
<span class="emphasis"><em>Connecting</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>Waiting for file</em></span> to
<span class="emphasis"><em>Downloading</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Resuming</em></span>. The final
value is the number of bytes downloaded from the remote site. Once the
download begins this is represented as <code class="literal">102/10.2k</code> indicating
that 102 bytes have been fetched and 10.2 kilobytes is expected. The total
size is always shown in 4 figure notation to preserve space. After the size
display is a percent meter for the file itself. The second last element is the
instantaneous average speed. This values is updated every 5 seconds and
reflects the rate of data transfer for that period. Finally is shown the
estimated transfer time. This is updated regularly and reflects the time to
complete everything at the shown transfer rate.

The status display updates every half second to provide a constant feedback on
the download progress while the Get lines scroll back whenever a new file is
started. Since the status display is constantly updated it is unsuitable for
logging to a file, use the <code class="literal">-q</code> option to remove the status
display.
